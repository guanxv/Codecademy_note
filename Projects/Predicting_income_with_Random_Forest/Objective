Predicting Income with Random Forests
In this project, we will be using a dataset containing census information from UCIâ€™s Machine Learning Repository.

By using this census data with a random forest, we will try to predict whether or not a person makes more than $50,000.

Letâ€™s get started!

Investigate The Data
1.
Letâ€™s begin by investigating the data available to us. Click on the file income.csv and take a look. Notice the first row of the dataset contains the names of our columns. What columns do you think might be helpful in predicting a personâ€™s income?

You can find more detailed descriptions of the columns on UCIâ€™s Machine Learning Repository.


Hint
If you close either income.csv or income.py, you can reopen it by clicking on the file image.

2.
Go back to the income.py file. We want to get all of that data into a Pandas DataFrame. Use the pd.read_csv() function using "income.csv" as a parameter and store the result in a variable named income_data. Since the first row of our file contains the names of the columns, we also want to add the argument header = 0.


Hint
Fill in the two parameters of the function:

income_data = pd.read_csv(____, ____)
3.
Take a look at one of the rows of the data weâ€™ve imported. Print income_data.iloc[0] to see the first row in its entirety. Did this person make more than $50,000? What is the name of the column that contains that information?


Hint
Youâ€™ll want to look for the "income" column.

4.
Thereâ€™s a small problem with our data that is a little hard to catch â€” every string has an extra space at the start. For example, the first rowâ€™s native-country is " United-States", but we want it to be "United-States". This is happening because in income.csv there are spaces after the commas. To fix this, we can add the parameter delimiter = ", " to our read_csv() function.


Hint
Add a third parameter to the read_csv() function:

income_data = pd.read_csv("income.csv", header = 0, ______)
Format The Data For Scikit-learn
5.
Now that we have our data imported into a DataFrame, we can begin putting it in a format that our Random Forest can work with. To do this, we need to separate the labels from the rest of the data.

For this project, the labels are in the column called "income". We want to grab only this column. You can get a single column from a DataFrame using this syntax:

one_column = data_frame_name[["column_name"]]
Create a variable named labels that contains only the column "income" from the income_data DataFrame.


Hint
Grab only the "income" column:

labels = income_data[[_____]]
6.
Weâ€™ll also want to pick which columns to use when trying to predict income. For now, letâ€™s select "age", "capital-gain", "capital-loss", "hours-per-week", and "sex". Create a new variable named data that contains only those columns. The syntax for this is very similar to selecting only one column:

many_columns = data_frame_name[["a", "b", "c"]]
In this example, many_columns now contains the columns "a", "b", and "c" from data_frame_name.


Hint
Get the five columns we want:

data = income_data[[_____, _____, _____, _____, _____]]
7.
Finally, we want to split our data and labels into a training set and a test set. Weâ€™ll use the training set to build the random forest, and the test set to see how accurate it is. Use the train_test_split() function to do this.

train_test_split() returns four values â€” name them train_data, test_data, train_labels, and test_labels. When calling train_test_split(), it should take three arguments â€” data, labels and random_state = 1.


Hint
Fill in the arguments to the function call:

train_data, test_data, train_labels, test_labels = train_test_split(_____, _____, _____)
Create The Random Forest
8.
Weâ€™re now ready to use this data to build and test our random forest. First, create a RandomForestClassifier and name it forest. When you create the random forest, use the parameter random_state = 1.


Hint
Make sure to add random_state = 1.

forest = RandomForestClassifier(_____)
9.
Next, we need to fit the model. We want to use the training data and training labels to train the random forest.

Call forestâ€˜s .fit() method using train_data and train_labels as parameters. When you run your code, there should be an error!


Hint
Complete the call to .fit() to train the forest using the training data:

forest.fit(_____, _____)
10.
There seems to be a problem with using the column "sex" when training the random forest.

In that column, there are values like "Male" and "Female". Random forests canâ€™t use columns that contain Strings â€” they have to be continuous values like integers or floats. Weâ€™ll solve this problem soon, but for now, letâ€™s remove the "sex" column when creating data.


Hint
Find the line of code where you create data and remove "sex" from the list of columns used.

11.
Now that our training set doesnâ€™t have a column containing strings, we have successfully fit our random forest.

We can now test its accuracy. Call forestâ€˜s .score() method using test_data and test_labels as parameters. Print the result.


Hint
This method call should be similar to the call to .fit(). Make sure to print the results!

Changing Column Types
12.
Now that we know the random forest works, letâ€™s go back and try to add the "sex" column.

Recall that the problem was that this column contained strings. If we transformed those strings into integers, we could use this data!

If we take every row and make every "Male" a 0 and every "Female" a 1, we could then use the column in our random forest. Before creating the data variable, use this line of code:

income_data["sex-int"] = income_data["sex"].apply(lambda row: 0 if row == "Male" else 1)
This creates a new column called "sex-int" in the income_data DataFrame. Every row in that new column contains a 0 if the rowâ€™s "sex" column contained "Male" and a 1 otherwise.


Hint
Make sure to create the "sex-int" column before creating the labels or data variables.

13.
Add "sex-int" to your list of columns included in data. What is your accuracy now?


Hint
Find where you create the data variable and "sex-int" to the list of used columns.

14.
There are a couple of other columns that use strings that might be useful to use. Letâ€™s try transforming the values in the "native-country" column.

We should first take a look at the different values that exist in the column. Print income_data["native-country"].value_counts().

15.
Since the majority of the data comes from "United-States", it might make sense to make a column where every row that contains "United-States" becomes a 0 and any other country becomes a 1. Use the syntax from creating the "sex-int" column to create a "country-int" column.

When mapping Strings to numbers like this, it is important to make sure that continuous numbers make sense. For example, it wouldnâ€™t make much sense to map "United-States" to 0, "Germany" to 1, and "Mexico" to 2. If we did this, weâ€™re saying that Mexico is more similar to Germany than it is to the United States.

However, if you had values in a column like "low", "medium", and "high" mapping those values to 0, 1, and 2 would make sense because their representation as Strings is also continuous.


Hint
income_data["_____"] =
